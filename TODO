# TODO

## Vital

- Level design
- I-frame anim bug???
- Find why fps influences speed (apparently make velocity increaes faster)

## Very important

- bug : charge spin dash while falling
- Use matrix to test less collisions
- Use new colision algo on enemies


## Cool stuff

- Change charge spin dash sprite
- Ring spread
- Animations (enemies)

## Misc

- Check if calling delete on enemy is needed
